# weborders-service

This project was built as an experiment to build a back-end API for web-orders.

It was built on top of the beautiful boilerplate [w3tecch/express-typescript-boilerplate](https://github.com/w3tecch/express-typescript-boilerplate).

It has evolved into a NestJS project in an integrated NRWL workspace in the repository [web-orders](https://github.com/FoxSGR/web-orders). Therefore, this repository is now archived.
